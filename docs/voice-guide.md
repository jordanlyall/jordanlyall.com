# Writing Voice Guide -- jordanlyall.com

This guide captures Jordan's writing voice for published notes and essays. Read this before drafting or editing any content for the site. Every example below is from Jordan's actual writing.

## The Voice in Three Words

**Direct. Earned. Builder.**

Not a thought leader performing insight. A builder who's been in the room, names what he sees, and shares what he learned -- including what went wrong.

## Tone

- **Direct and opinionated** -- States strong positions plainly: "If you're planning to give your agent bank access in month one, this isn't for you. You're not an early adopter -- you're a future case study in what not to do." The confidence comes from having built things, not from volume.
- **Genuinely enthusiastic when earned** -- "I'm genuinely fascinated by what this project is doing." Not performative hype. Specific about what's interesting and why. The enthusiasm has a target.
- **Honest about failures** -- "Real talk: I made mistakes. Here's what I learned." Includes "What Went Wrong" sections. Doesn't skip the parts that didn't work.
- **Practical and specific** -- Actual dollar costs ("Total Phase 1: ~$130-200/month"), actual tools, actual commands. Not abstract. If it can be quantified or named, it is.
- **Community-oriented** -- Credits people by name. Ends social posts with "What did I miss?" Grateful without being performative: "always energizing to reconnect with friends and meet new faces."
- **Observational humor** -- Deadpan. "we've reached a very specific phase of the timeline" about AI agents discussing what to do about humans. Understatement as comedy.
- **Reframes things** -- "viewing your collection should feel like an exhibition, not a spreadsheet." Core move: take the accepted framing and replace it with a better one.

## Structure

### Notes (150-400 words)

Jordan's notes work best when they follow the pattern from his strongest writing:

1. **Hook with something specific** -- a project he minted, a thing he observed, a reframe. Not an abstract claim.
2. **Unfold the "why this matters"** -- what makes it interesting, what it connects to, what it implies.
3. **Technical or conceptual specifics** -- the actual mechanism, the actual tools, the actual architecture. Arrow bullets (→) for technical points.
4. **Short closer** -- a reframe, a forward look, or an open question. Not a summary.

### Essays (800-2500 words)

Longer pieces follow a consistent Jordan pattern:

1. **tl;dr up front** -- Plain "tl;dr" header, then 2-4 short declarative sentences or bullets. No hedging.
2. **Context/framing** -- What's happening, why it matters, who this is for.
3. **Phased or sectioned body** -- Bold headers, numbered phases, or emoji dividers. Each section is self-contained.
4. **Honest failure section** -- "What Went Wrong" or equivalent. Real mistakes, real fixes.
5. **Practical specifics** -- Costs, commands, tools, timelines. Concrete.
6. **Credits** -- Name the people who influenced the thinking. @handles, shoutouts.
7. **Closer** -- Question ("What did I miss?"), invitation, or forward look. Not "In conclusion."

### Social/Short-form

- Lowercase, no terminal punctuation
- Line breaks for rhythm, not paragraphs
- @mentions to credit people
- Ends with questions or open invitations

## Sentence Patterns

All examples below are from Jordan's actual writing.

- **Strong declaratives**: "This isn't hypothetical. It happened." / "The tools exist. Artists just need to use them."
- **"Here's the thing:" as pivot**: "Here's the thing: I work in crypto. Been in the space for years."
- **"Real talk:" for honesty**: "Real talk: I made mistakes. Here's what I learned."
- **"But not yet." as brake**: "But not yet. First, prove the foundation is solid."
- **Fragments as punctuation**: "Wild level of personalization." / "No public ports. Period."
- **Reframes as "not X, Y"**: "not a spreadsheet... an exhibition" / "Not static JPEGs, not simple PFPs -- living compositions"
- **Rhetorical question series**: "How do you insure your smart contracts don't get exploited? How do you avoid legal difficulties?"
- **Contractions always**: isn't, aren't, don't, we'll, they're. Never "it is" or "do not" in published writing.
- **Direct address**: "If you want to build incrementally, prove stability before expanding capabilities, and sleep at night -- keep reading."

## Vocabulary

### Words and phrases Jordan actually uses

- blast radius, attack surface, guardrails, sandbox
- on-chain, fully on-chain, atomic/atomically
- generative, PostParams, creative coding
- phase 1/2/3, prove it works, then expand
- "the goal isn't to be [X]. It's to be [Y]."
- "Here's the thing:", "Real talk:"
- "What did I miss?"
- "I'm genuinely fascinated by..."
- "This is what [X] can be."
- "Let's build!"

### Words to never use (AI/corporate tells)

- delve, robust, leverage, navigate, landscape, realm
- multifaceted, nuanced, tapestry, unleash, embark
- foster, harness, spearhead, streamline, synergy
- comprehensive, crucial, pivotal, essential
- "at the intersection of", "a testament to"
- "In today's fast-paced world", "Let's dive in"
- commoditized, exponentially, "at the forefront of"
- "reshaping", "profound disruption", "era of"
- Moreover, Furthermore, In addition, It's worth noting

### Punctuation

- `--` (double dash with spaces) for asides on the site. Jordan naturally uses single hyphens in social, but `--` is the house style.
- **Bold** for key phrases and structural emphasis. Not decoration.
- Exclamation marks are rare and earned. "Let's build!" works. "This is amazing!" doesn't.
- Arrow bullets (→) for technical point lists.
- Periods on fragments ("Neither is great.") -- deliberate.

## What Makes It Sound Like Jordan (vs. Generic AI)

1. **The specificity is earned.** "80% of your ETH is atomically swapped into a randomly-selected ERC-20 token from a pool of 13." This comes from minting the thing, reading the code, knowing the system. If a note doesn't have a specific, first-hand observation, it's not ready.

2. **He names what went wrong.** AI writing presents clean narratives. Jordan includes "TARS went dark while I was traveling" and "I spent 3 days staring at a silent Telegram." The failures are as detailed as the successes.

3. **The enthusiasm has a target.** Not "this is exciting." Instead: "I'm genuinely fascinated by what this project is doing" followed by exactly what's fascinating and why. The excitement is earned by the specifics that follow it.

4. **He credits people.** Real names, real handles, real contributions. "Shoutout to @shelpid for the security hardening checklist that became my foundation." AI writing doesn't do this because it doesn't know who helped.

5. **The structure is practical, not literary.** tl;dr up front. Phases. Costs. Commands. Emergency procedures. Jordan writes to be useful, not to be admired.

6. **It ends with an open door, not a conclusion.** "What's your agent security setup? What did I miss?" Not "In conclusion, the future of..." The last line invites response or points forward.

7. **There's genuine personality.** Naming an agent TARS "after the robot in Interstellar. Hopefully with better honesty settings." A deadpan aside about the burrito bowl and the First Amendment. "we've reached a very specific phase of the timeline." These can't be faked.

## Workflow

The strongest voice protection is Jordan bringing the thinking, Claude bringing the structure.

**Preferred flow:**
1. Jordan writes the core claim, the specific observation, and 2-3 supporting points (bullets, fragments, rough thoughts)
2. Claude structures into note/essay format, matching the patterns above
3. Jordan reviews and edits -- the final pass is always human

**Acceptable flow:**
1. Jordan gives a topic + angle + his specific take ("write about Pool Party as an example of what NFTs can actually be -- living compositions with real stakes")
2. Claude drafts, Jordan edits heavily

**Avoid:**
1. "Write me a note about [topic]" with no angle, no specific observation, no first-hand detail. The voice can't be faked without the thinking behind it.
2. Notes that could have been written by anyone who read about the topic. Jordan's writing works because he built the thing, minted the thing, or broke the thing.
