Agent security framework born from hardening TARS against prompt injection. Defines forbidden actions, injection defense (encoding attacks, indirect vectors, persona hijacking, progressive escalation), instruction confidentiality, and incident response.

Built after a red team audit scored the original agent 2/100 on security. The spec is the fix.
