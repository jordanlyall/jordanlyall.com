Not a blog, not a marketing site. Long-term personal infrastructure that serves two audiences: humans (clean reading experience) and AI agents (structured manifests, feeds, intake endpoint).

Includes `.well-known` agent discovery, JSON-LD identity, RSS feeds, microformats, and a structured proposal intake system that posts to Slack.
