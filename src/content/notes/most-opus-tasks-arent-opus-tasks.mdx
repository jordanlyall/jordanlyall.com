title: "Most Opus Tasks Aren't Opus Tasks"
summary: "Opus is the safe default when you're building fast. But a three-line tier table in my system prompt taught the model to flag when it's overkill."

Anthropic just dropped Sonnet 4.6. It's fast and it's good. But the real question isn't which model to use -- it's when you're reaching for the expensive one out of habit.

When you're deep in a build, Opus feels like the safe default. It handles everything you throw at it. But "handles everything" isn't the same as "needed for everything." I was using Opus for tasks that Sonnet would've nailed -- meeting prep, code review, project planning -- because I never set up guardrails to tell me otherwise.

## The fix

I added a tier table directly to my `CLAUDE.md` system prompt:

```
| Tier      | Model  | Use For                                          |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Haiku     | haiku  | Lookups, grep, file reads, status checks          |
| Sonnet    | sonnet | Daily workflows, planning, reviews, writing        |
| Opus      | opus   | Complex architecture, multi-domain synthesis        |
```

Then one behavioral instruction: "Actively flag when I'm using the wrong tier for a task."

That's it. The model now nudges me when something doesn't warrant Opus, or when a task genuinely needs the upgrade from Sonnet.

## What surprised me

~95% of my daily work runs fine on Sonnet. The tasks that feel like they need Opus don't. Opus earns its cost for maybe 5% of the work: multi-file architecture decisions, board-of-advisors deliberations, new system design.

The model doesn't know what it costs. You have to tell it. And once you do, it's surprisingly good at self-selecting.
