Sharp tools beat Swiss Army knives.

After building 18 MCP tools for the WC26 server, I learned: one great tool > five mediocre ones.

Design principles:
- Narrow scope, clear inputs
- Deterministic outputs
- Explicit error states
- No hidden state

LLMs use specific tools more reliably than catch-all tools. The MCP spec rewards specialists.

Build the scalpel, not the multi-tool.
