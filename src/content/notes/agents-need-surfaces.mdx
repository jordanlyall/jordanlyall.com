Most of the agent conversation is about capabilities -- what can they do, how autonomous should they be, which model runs underneath.

Less discussed: **where do agents go?**

Right now, the answer is mostly APIs with auth tokens, or screen-scraping human interfaces. Neither is great. APIs are gated and siloed. Screen-scraping is fragile and adversarial.

## What's missing

A middle layer. Something like:

- **Structured manifests** that tell agents what a person or site offers
- **Intake endpoints** that accept proposals in a machine-readable format
- **Discovery files** that let agents find capabilities without crawling

This isn't a new protocol. It's just JSON files at well-known paths, RSS feeds with structured metadata, and forms that accept `application/json` alongside HTML.

The primitives already exist. We just haven't assembled them for agents yet.
