After years at Art Blocks, one pattern keeps surfacing: the artists who make the most compelling work think like systems designers, not painters.

They're not choosing colors. They're defining **constraint spaces** -- the boundaries within which randomness and algorithm interact to produce something neither fully controlled nor fully chaotic.

## Why this matters beyond art

This is exactly the same mental model needed for:

- **Agent orchestration** -- define the guardrails, let the system operate within them
- **Protocol design** -- constrain the space of valid actions, let participants fill it
- **Product architecture** -- build the affordances, let users surprise you

Generative art isn't a niche. It's a design philosophy that happens to produce images. The real output is a way of thinking about systems, constraints, and emergence.
