title: "Designing for Invariants"
summary: "In an era of rapid platform and protocol churn, the smartest move is building systems that survive collapse -- not ones that predict the future."

From where I sit, three shifts seem to be reshaping the web:

1. **Agents increasingly act on our behalf** -- not replacing humans, but mediating discovery, synthesis, and action.
2. **Identity becomes more programmable** -- wallets, attestations, passkeys, signed statements.
3. **Click-based traffic keeps declining** -- search becomes answers, feeds become summaries.

## The implication

Feels less important to predict the specifics, more important to design systems that survive those forces.

That means optimizing for:
- **Canonical density** over platform dependency
- **Structured surfaces** over clever UI
- **Machine legibility** over SEO tricks
- **Reversible architecture** over premature commitment

The details will churn. The invariants won't.
